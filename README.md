# Freedom of the Nodes

The principle of Freedom of the Nodes establishes that decentralized networks—when containing native assets, governed by open-source code, sufficiently decentralized, and universally accessible—may be freely used without conditions by every human being.

## Containing Native Assets

Assets are considered native when they exist only on a decentralized network and independent of any single jurisdiction's legal system of rights and duties.

## Governed by Open-Source Code

Governance by code means the decentralized network's protocol runs according to fixed parameters where only limited changes are possible and require acceptance from network participants to take effect. Open-source means anyone can download and suggest improvements to the network's code, and because no single person owns it, it does not fall under one jurisdiction.

## Sufficiently Decentralized

Sufficiently decentralized means that the technology forms a decentralized network where no single person or identifiable group controls access to the technology, carries out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, or can restrict specific transactions or exclude specific persons.

## Universally Accessible

Universally accessible means that the technology supporting the decentralized network and its transactions must be publicly available through electronic devices without discrimination or special permission. All required software must be freely downloadable and any person may use the code and network to create applications for private or public purposes.

## About This Project

This project permanently stores the Freedom of the Nodes principle on the Ethereum blockchain and provides easy-to-use tools for displaying it on any website. The purpose is to create an immutable record of this fundamental principle that transcends jurisdictional limitations.

### Key Features

**Immutable Storage**: The Freedom of the Nodes principle is permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain
**Universal Access**: Anyone can access and display this document through the blockchain
**Easy Integration**: Simple HTML/JavaScript snippet for adding to any website
**Transparent**: Open-source code and documentation for all components

### About This Initiative

This project is part of an initiative to publish legal instruments on blockchain. It demonstrates that decentralized blockchains can serve as a foundation for principles that govern decentralized networks themselves. While this is a static on-chain publication, it invites reflection on new approaches to digital governance that transcend traditional jurisdictional frameworks.

The Freedom of the Nodes principle aims to protect the free and unconditional use of decentralized networks similarly to the use of the open oceans.

## Getting Started

### Display the Freedom of the Nodes on Your Website

You can easily display the Freedom of the Nodes principle on your website by adding a simple HTML/JavaScript snippet that fetches the content directly from the Ethereum blockchain.

The repository includes a ready-to-use implementation file at [frontend/FreedomOfTheNodesFrontEnd.html](frontend/FreedomOfTheNodesFrontEnd.html) that you can download and adapt to your needs.

The implementation:
- Loads the content directly from the Ethereum blockchain
- Provides customizable styling options
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Includes caching for better performance

See the [Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION.md) for detailed instructions on adding this to your website.
